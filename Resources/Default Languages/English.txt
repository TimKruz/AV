Introduction to the basic functions of the AV
Before work, check out the buttons and menu. The first button opens the main menu, the second opens the menu to change the language of the program, the third program enters sleep mode, the fourth opens is the help window, the fifth closes this program.
To get started, you need to log in to the project's server. To do this, you need to register using the appropriate form - it will appear in front of you after loading the program. You can log in without registration: to do this, click "Log in as a guest". However, the guest account is limited, so we encourage you to register.
After login you can start to work. Click the "Exchange Center" tab, download the starter kit or needed modules and the Virtuals, then return to "Virtuals" tab, select or create a Virtual and click "Load". You will be prompted to select the loadable modules. After loading, you can chat, play and work with the selected Virtual. Your actions are limited only by a set of loaded modules and your imagination!
Congratulations, now you know the basic principles of working with the program Amiga Virtual!

Control-code:
control-code undefined
Some of selected modules have the same control-code. This can lead to an endless cycle: the modules with the same control-codes will throw each other every message like playing tennis. However, it is not dangerous - the main program does not freezes, and you can always turn off Virtual. Click "OK" and uncheck unnecessary modules. Or you can load Virtual with conflicting modules - press the "Ignore".
